<br>
It uses PowerShell commands to set CPU affinity of the game to CPU (0), then back to all CPUs. 
This effectively eliminates the in-game lag caused by this affinity bug.
<br>
<br>
The fix is temporary, while the game is running.
<br>
It's purpose is to reduce the time it takes to manually set affinity, so you can get back to your game much faster.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Both Vulkan and DirectX 11 APIs supported.
